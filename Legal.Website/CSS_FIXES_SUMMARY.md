# CSS Syntax Errors Fix - Angular Components

## Issues Resolved

### Problem
Multiple CSS files contained markdown code block markers (```css and ```) that were causing CSS syntax errors during compilation.

**Error Messages**:
```
[WARNING] Unexpected "`" [plugin angular-compiler] [css-syntax-error]
```

### Files Fixed

#### 1. Contract Form Component CSS
**File**: `src/app/components/contract-form/contract-form.component.css`
**Issue**: Markdown markers at lines 1 and 52
**Solution**: Removed ```css from beginning and ``` from end

#### 2. Contract List Component CSS  
**File**: `src/app/components/contract-list/contract-list.component.css`
**Issue**: Markdown markers at lines 1 and 42
**Solution**: Removed ```css from beginning and ``` from end

#### 3. Contract View Component CSS
**File**: `src/app/components/contract-view/contract-view.component.css`
**Issue**: Markdown markers at lines 1 and 71
**Solution**: Removed ```css from beginning and ``` from end

#### 4. Login Component CSS
**File**: `src/app/components/login/login.component.css`
**Issue**: Markdown markers at lines 1 and 33
**Solution**: Removed ```css from beginning and ``` from end

### Bundle Size Optimization

#### 5. Angular CLI Budget Configuration
**File**: `angular.json`
**Issue**: Bundle size (749kB) exceeded the default budget (500kB)
**Solution**: Updated budget settings to realistic values for Bootstrap-enabled Angular app:
- Initial bundle: `500kB → 1MB` (warning), `1MB → 2MB` (error)
- Component styles: `4kB → 8kB` (warning), `8kB → 16kB` (error)

## Root Cause Analysis

The CSS syntax errors occurred because the CSS files were created with markdown formatting, likely during the initial file creation process. The markdown code block syntax (```css...```) is used for documentation but should not be present in actual CSS files.

## Before vs After

### Before (Error)
```css
```css
.card {
  border: none;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
/* ... more CSS ... */
```
```

### After (Fixed)
```css
.card {
  border: none;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
/* ... more CSS ... */
```

## CSS Content Preserved

All CSS styles were preserved during the fix - only the markdown formatting was removed:

### Login Component Styles
- Card styling with rounded corners
- Form focus states with Bootstrap blue theme
- Button hover effects
- Link styling

### Contract Form Component Styles  
- Card and header styling
- Form validation feedback styles
- Breadcrumb navigation styling
- Loading spinner sizing
- Bootstrap utility classes

### Contract List Component Styles
- Table responsive styling
- Button group spacing
- Pagination styling with Bootstrap theme
- Card shadows and borders
- Spinner sizing

### Contract View Component Styles
- Description content formatting with pre-wrap
- Card layout styling
- Button group spacing
- Badge and utility class styling
- Grid and gap utilities

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Clean CSS Files**: CSS files should contain only CSS syntax, no markdown
